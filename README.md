# Installation

or

```

# Setup

This project depends on [umi](https://umijs.org/)'s [routing system](https://umijs.org/docs/routing) and [@umijs/plugin-layout
](https://umijs.org/plugins/plugin-layout), all top level routes should be wrapped in a `TabLayout`, and pages need to be displayed in a `Tab` should be wrapped by a `RouteWatcher` in order to notify the library when that page open..

Since umi's config file only receive strings as route component's values. So we can create two files in our project and import/export `TabLayout` and `RouteWatcher` from the library.

For example, we create `TabLayout.tsx` and `RouteWatcher.tsx` in `src/components/PageTab`:

**TabLayout.tsx:**

```js
import { TabLayout } from 'antd-pro-page-tabs';

export default TabLayout;
```


**RouteWatcher.tsx**

```js
import { RouteWatcher } from 'antd-pro-page-tabs';

export default RouteWatcher;
```

Next, we update the routing configuration of our project like:

```js
const RouteWatcher = '@/components/PageTab/RouteWatcher';

export default {
  ...

  routes: [
    {
      path: '/',
      component: '@/components/PageTab/TabLayout',
      flatMenu: true, // lift sub-routes to top up
      routes: [
        {
          name: 'Home',
          icon: 'smile',
          path: '/home',
          component: '@/pages/home',
          wrappers: [RouteWatcher],
        },
        {
          name: 'About',
          icon: 'smile',
          path: '/about',
          component: '@/pages/about',
          wrappers: [RouteWatcher],
        },
        {
          name: 'Contact',
          icon: 'smile',
          path: '/contact',
          component: '@/pages/contact',
          wrappers: [RouteWatcher],
        }
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

**üí• Don't forget to set `flatMenu` of the root route to `true`, it will hide the root route menu and lift the sub-routes to the top level, and then menus will be created for them.**

# Features

* Enable/disable opening pages in tab by setting `RouteWatcher` or not

* Keep pages' states alive when switching between tabs

* Close opened tabs by click `x` button

* Tab and route is a one-to-one relationship, pages of different route will be in different tabs, different pages of same route (like news detail pages) will be in the same tab

* If all tabs are closed, page of root route will be opened

# Todos

While this library is still a simple prototype, there are still a lot things i can do to make it better:

* Add right-click context menus, including: close other tabs, close tabs on the right

* Add APIs to close specific tabs programmatically

* Add APIs to enable customizing tab bar or tab styles

* etc..

Any suggestions is welcomed. Enjoy! üéà
